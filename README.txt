The purpose of this Git repository is to house and display my various projects throughout my Web Development course. 

My favorite assignment was implementing a 2048 server and database. My undersatnding grew the most over the course of this assignment, and I felt like my grasp of how the web works really solidified through creating this project. 

I think I have grown in two ways in this course. First, my understanding of the web and how websites and servers work is much clearer than before I enrolled in this course. Additionally, I feel as though my perserverance, patience, and resource-finding skills have also grown immensely from this course. 

I think the most important thing I learned from this course is the architecture of the web. One example is get and post requests to servers. While I knew servers existed, I was definitely unsure of their role and how webpages interacted with them. Similarly, I learned a great deal about the difference between front-end and back-end operations, and what is happening with my data when a computer uses it. The difference between local storage and database storage is an example of this. 

Now that I have finished the course, I would like to delve deeper into how webpages are hosted on the web -- ie not using Heroku -- and dive deeper into the design and layout of webpages.
