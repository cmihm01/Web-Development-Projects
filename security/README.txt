I completed this entire assignment. However, my partner had protections against my security attacks, so all of my attacks were not successful. I was, however, correctly able to view which lines of my partner's code were disabling my attacks. 
I discussed methods with Katie Hoskins. 

I spent about 5 hours on this assignment.
